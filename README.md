# Workplace Out of Office bot

A simple Out of Office bot for Workplace. Set your OOO by messaging the bot. OOO messages can be set for a fixed period of time or indefinately. If a user messages an OOO user, they will receive a reply with the OOO user's message. If an OOO user is tagged in a group post the bot will reply to the poster to let them know the user is away. The bot tracks who it has replied to so that it doesn't repeatedly contact the poster.
